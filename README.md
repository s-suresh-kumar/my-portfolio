 ## Description

 This app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is front-end only application. It stores 6 thumbnails of my projects to showcase. It has mainly 3 pages, About, Portfolio and Contact.  Each of the page in itself is designed to be a react component. Of the 3 components, Portfolio is a class component where as the other two are functional component. There are several other components to render different parts of the HTML such as Title, Wrapper, Navbar, Header etc., most of them having their own css files as well. The projects' information are stored in json array and rendered using Project component. 

 ## Deployed-Application

The deployed application can be found at:  https://s-suresh-kumar.github.io/my-portfolio/

 ## Installation
Just clone the repository, and issue `npm i` to install dependencies. To use locally, one has to issue `npm start` which will launch the app on the default browser. 

 ## Instructions

From this website, one can learn about me and get contact info by visiting the About Page. There are links to LinkedIn, Github, Resume in the about page. Also email and Phone is listed.  By going to the Portfolio Page, some of my completed projects can be seen. Each of the project has the thumbnail, name of the project, links to github repository and link to deployed application. When I get more time for this, I will plan to make it even prettier. The contact page has a contact form which is implemented using formspree, it is functional and sends the filled form to my e-mail address. Again the contact page needs better styling than what is there right now. Plan to work on it when I can devote more time to it.

 ## Tests

 There are no automated tests written for this app. However it is easy to launch the app by going to https://s-suresh-kumar.github.io/my-portfolio/, Once the page is visited, it is straight forward to navigate the different pages of the app , learn about me and my portfolio as well as contact me.
